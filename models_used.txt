Precision is more important than Recall when you would like to have less False Positives in trade off to have more False Negatives. Meaning, getting a False Positive is very costly, and a False Negative is not as much.

Imagine a zombie apocalypse. You would try to accept as many healthy people as you can into your safe zone, but you really dont want to mistakenly pass a zombie. The true positive is this case is a healthy person and false positive a zombie. It is more important to avoid zombies than accepting more healthy people. So you create a method that causes some of the healthy people mistakenly not to get into the safe zone, but this is the cost of not letting a zombie in.
